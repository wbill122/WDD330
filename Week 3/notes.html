    Object methods, "this"
    “this” in methods<br>
    It’s common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job.
    For instance, the code inside user.sayHi() may need the name of the user.
    <br>
    
    <br>Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.
    <br>Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().
    <br>Methods can reference the object as this.
    <br>The value of this is defined at run-time.
    <br>
    When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is called.
    A function can be copied between objects.
    When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call is object.
    Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no this. When this is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from outside.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>function makeUser() {
        <br>return {
            <br>name: "bill",
            <br>ref() {
                <br>return this;
                <br> }
                <br>};
                <br>}
                <br>let user = makeUser();
                <br>alert(user.ref().name);
                <br>

    Everything in JavaScript is either one of the six primitive data types we met in Chapter 2 (strings, numbers, booleans, symbols, undefined, and null) or an object. We’ve actually met some objects already; arrays in Chapter 3 and functions in Chapter 4 are both objects, although these are built-in objects that are part of the language. In this chapter we’re going to look at user-defined objects, as well as some of the other built-in objects.<br>
    <br>An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions.
    <br>
    <h3>Chapter 5 Summary<h3>

     •	Objects are a collection of key-value pairs placed inside curly braces {}.<br>
    •	Objects have properties that can be any JavaScript value. If it’s a function, it’s known as amethod.<br>
    •	An object’s properties and methods can be accessed using either dot notation or square bracket notation.<br>
    •	Objects are mutable, which means their properties and methods can be changed or removed.<br>
    •	Objects can be used as parameters to functions, which allows arguments to be entered in any order, or omitted.<br>
    •	Nested objects can be created by placing objects inside objects.<br>
    •	JSON is a portable data format that uses JavaScript object literals to exchange information.<br>
    •	The Math object gives access to a number of mathematical constants.<br>
    •	The Math object can be used to perform mathematical calculations.<br>
    •	The Date object can be used to create date objects.<br>
    •	Once you’ve created a Date object, you can use the getter methods to access information about that date.<br>
    •	Once you’ve created a Date object, setter methods can be used to change information about that date.<br>
    •	The Regex object can be used to create regular expressions.<br>

    The Document Object Model
    <br>The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page and enable interaction with the page by adding and removing elements, changing the order, content and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled.
    
    <br>Query Selectors
    The document.querySelector() method allows you to use CSS notation to find thefirstelement in the document that matches that matches a CSS selector provided as an argument. If no elements match, it will return null .
    <br>
    The document.querySelectorAll() method also uses CSS notation but returns a node list ofallthe elements in the document that match the CSS query selector. If no elements match, it will return an empty node list.
    <br>
    The className Property
    As we’ve seen, we can modify the class name of an element using the setAttribute() method. There is also a className property that allows the class of an element to be set directly. In addition, it can be used to find out the value of the class attribute:
    <br>
<h3>Chapter 6 Summary</h3>
    <br>•	The Document Object Model is a way of representing a page of HTML as a tree of nodes.
    <br>•	The document.getElementById() , document.getElementsByClassName() , document.getElementsByTagNames() and document.querySelector() can be used to access elements on a page.
    <br>•	The parentNode() , previousSibling() , nextSibling() , childNodes() and children() methods can be used to navigate around the DOM tree.
    <br>•	An element’s attributes can be accessed using the getAttribute() method, and updated using the setAttribute() method.
    <br>•	The createElement() and createTextNode() methods can be used to create dynamic markup on the fly.
    <br>•	Markup can be added to the page using the appendChild() and insertBefore() methods.
    <br>•	Elements can be replaced using the replaceChild() method, and removed using the removeChild() method.
    <br>•	The innerHTML property can be used to insert raw HTML directly into the DOM.
    <br>•	The CSS properties of an element can be changed by accessing the style property.
    <br>  
    
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    Events
    <br>
    Events are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the web page and user interactions. Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program can detect and then respond to.
    <br>
    Using Event Listeners
    The recommended way of dealing with events, and the current standard, is to use event listeners. These were outlined in DOM level 2 and allow multiple functions to be attached independently to different events. They are supported in all modern browsers, although only in Internet Explorer from version 9 onwards.
    <br>
    The addEventListener() method is called on a node object, the node to which the event listener is being applied. For example, this code will attach an event listener to the document’s body:
    <br>
    <h3>Chapter 7 Summary</h3>
    •	Events occur when a user interacts with a web page.<br>
    •	An event listener is attached to an element, then invokes a callback function when the event occurs.<br>
    •	The event object is passed to the callback function as an argument, and contains lots of properties and methods relating to the event.<br>
    •	There are many types of event, including mouse events, keyboard events, and touch events.<br>
    •	You can remove an event using the removeEventListener method.<br>
    •	The default behavior of elements can be prevented using the preventDefault() function.<br>
    •	Event propagation is the order the events fire on each element.<br>
    •	Event delegation is when an event listener is added to a parent element to capture events that happen to its children elements.<br>
    •	In the next chapter, we’ll look at how we can use forms to enter information into the browser, and use events to process that information.<br>
