    <h1>10 Testing and Debugging</h1>
    <h2>Linting Tools</h2>
    Linting tools are also useful for enforcing a programmingstyle guide. This is particularly useful when you are working in a team, as it ensures everybody follows the same conventions.<br>
    <h2>Feature Detection</h2>
    Modernizris a library that offers an easy way to implement feature detection andCan I Use?is another useful resource for checking which features are currently supported in different browsers.<br>
    <h2>Debugging Tools</h2>
    One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to. <br>You can also hover over any variables to see what value they hold at that point. The program can then be restarted by clicking on the 'play' button.<br>
    <h2>Jest</h2>
    Jest is a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of popularity recently. It makes it easy to create and run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions.<br>
    To use Jest, first we need to install it using npm . Enter the following command in a terminal
    
    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
    <br>•	Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it’s best to find them early rather than later.
    <br>•	JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string "use strict" . This can be used in a whole file or just a single function.
    <br> •	Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and conventions.
    <br>•	Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown.
    <br>•	The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and fix bugs in code.
    <br>•	Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement.
    <br>•	An error object is created when an exception occurs.
    <br>•	Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error objects to a catch block when an exception occurs. Any code inside a finally block will run if an exception does or does not occur.
    <br>•	Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented.
    <br>•	The Jest framework can be used to test your code..
