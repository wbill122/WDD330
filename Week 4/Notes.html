    <h2>8 Forms</h2>

    Forms<br><br>
    Forms are made up of a _form_ element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons. These input fields can be populated with information that is processed once the form has been submitted.
    <br>
    Accessing Form Elements
    The legacy DOM had a useful property called document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup.
    <br>
    The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically. Note that submitting a form using this method won’t trigger the form submit event that's covered in the next section.
    <br>
    Submitting a Form
    Possibly the most important form event is the submit event, occurring when the form is submitted. Usually this will send the content of the form to the server to be processed, but we can use JavaScript to intercept the form before it’s sent by adding a submit event listener. 
    <br><br>
    Some common types of form control are:
    <br>
     input_ fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads
     <br>
     select_ menus for drop-down lists of options
     <br>
     textarea_ elements for longer text entry
     <br>
     button_ elements for submitting and resetting forms
     <br>
    Radio buttons are created using input fields with type='radio' . Like checkboxes they allow users to check an option as true , but they provide an exclusive choice of options, soonly one optioncan be selected.
    <br>
    <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
    •	Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.
    <br>
    •	Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information.
    <br>
    •	HTML5 has a large number of new input types that are beginning to be implemented in modern browsers.
    <br>
    •	document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.
    <br>
    •	form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.
    <br>
    •	Forms have focus , blur , and change events that fire as a user interacts with the form.
    <br>
    •	Forms also have a submit event that can be used to intercept a form before it’s been submitted.
    <br>
    •	The information entered into a form can be read or updated using the value property of the form controls.
    <br>
    
    •	The HTML5 form validation API can be used to automatically validate a form, but only at a basic level, so a custom validation script may be required.<br>

    <h2>12 Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h2>
    <br>
<h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
Object-oriented programming is often used to model representations of objects in
the real world. There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation,
polymorphism and inheritance.
<br>
<h3>Encapsulation</h3>
In OOP, this involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to know how it’s done.
<br><br>
<h3>Polymorphism</h3>
polymorphism: the same process can be used for different objects.
<br>In OOP, this means various objects can share the same method, but also have the
<br>ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.

<h3>Inheritance</h3>
In OOP, this means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.<br> 
<h3>Classes</h3>
Many object-oriented languages, such as Java and Ruby, are known as class-based languages. This is because they use a class to define a blueprint for an object. Objects are then created as an instance of that class, and inherit all the properties and methods of the class.<br>

<h3>Conclusion Chapter Summary</h3>
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of programming that uses objects that encapsulate their own properties and methods.
<br>
•	The main concepts of OOP are encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.
<br>
•	Constructor functions can be used to create instances of objects.
<br>
•	ES6 introduced class declarations that use the class keyword. These can be used in place of constructor functions.
<br>
•	Inside a constructor function or class declaration, the keyword this refers to the object returned by the function.
<br>
•	All instances of a class or constructor function inherit all the properties and methods of its prototype.
<br>
•	The prototype is live, so new properties and methods can be added to existing instances.
<br>
•	The prototype chain is used to find an available method. If an object lacks a method, JavaScript will check whether its prototype has the method. If not, it will check that function’s prototype until it finds the method or reaches the Object constructor function.
<br>
•	Private properties and methods can be created by defining variables using const and defining a function inside a constructor function. These can be made public using getter and setter functions.
<br>
•	Monkey-patching is the process of adding methods to built-in objects by augmenting their prototypes. This should be done with caution as it can cause unexpected behavior in the way built-in objects work.
<br>
•	A mixin method can be used to add properties and methods from other objects without creating an inheritance chain.
<br>
•	Methods can be chained together and called in sequence if they return a reference to this.
<br>
•	Polymorphism allows objects to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.
<br>
•	The value of this is not retained inside nested functions, which can cause errors. This can be worked around by using that = this , using the bind(this) method and using arrow functions.
<br>
•	Methods can be borrowed from other objects.
<br>
•	Composition over inheritance is a design pattern where objects are composed from 'building-block' objects, rather than inheriting all their properties and methods from a parent class.

<h2>15 Modern JavaScript Development</h2>
<br>15 Modern JavaScript Development

<br>A big advantage of using jQuery is its support for older browsers, particularly Internet Explorer.

<h3>Underscore & Lodash</h3>
UnderscoreandLodashare very similar libraries of functions that provide additional functionality to the language. They both provide a large number of utility functions under the namespace _ (this is where they get their name from as the _ character is often referred to as an 'underscore' or a 'lodash'). A number of JavaScript libraries list one of these as a core dependency.


<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Libraries</h3>

A big advantage of utilizing a popular library is that it will be used by lots of people and thoroughly tested. It will most likely have been optimized and battle-tested for nearly every eventuality. Using a library means you can be confident that your code will be as bullet-proof as possible in many browsers. In addition, there will usually be lots of online documentation and a strong community ready to help out if you become stuck. The popularity of libraries often means that others will have encountered the same problem as you, often making it easy to find a solution by searching on the internet.

<h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
•	JavaScript libraries provide methods to make common tasks easier to achieve.<br>
<br>•	Libraries can make programming much easier, but you should think carefully about whether you require a library, and which one is best for your needs.
<br>•	jQuery and Lodash are two popular libraries that provide a large number of useful and well-tested functions.
<br>•	npm and Yarn are package managers that can be used to install JavaScript packages, as well as any dependencies that they require.
<br>•	A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules.
<br>•	ES6 added support for modules, allowing code to be abstracted into their own self-contained files and imported into another file.
<br>•	The MVC pattern is used to organize code into distinct sections that are responsible for different elements of an application.
<br>•	Template files can be used to separate view code from JavaScript; they also enable dynamic code and programming logic to be used to generate markup.
<br>•	React and Vue.js are popular JavaScript view libraries that render components and keep track of their state.
<br>•	Minification is the process of removing any redundant characters from the code in order to reduce its file size.
<br>•	Files can be compressed on the server using the gzip compression tool.
<br>•	Webpack can be used to bundle multiple files into a single bundle, and automate common tasks such as transpiling, minifying code and running tests.
<br>•	Before code is deployed, it should be concatenated into a single file, minified and compressed. The script tag should be placed just before the closing _body_ tag to ensure that all elements on the page have loaded before the script runs.
