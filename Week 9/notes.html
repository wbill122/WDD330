    <h1>Notes</h1> 
    <h2>The Window Object Chapter 9</h2>
    <h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
    <br>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.<br>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer.<br> They were invented by Netscape as a way of getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol.<br> <br>This means that a browser does not remember anything from one request to another.<br>So every time a user visits a page, nothing about any previous visits is remembered.<br> Cookies can be used to sidestep this problem by storing information that can then be retrieved between requests.<br>
    <h3>The Path and Domain of Cookies</h3>
    By default, cookies can only be read by pages inside the same directory and domain as the file was set.<br> This is for security reasons so that access to the cookie is limited.<br>
    <h3>setInterval()</h3>
    The window.<br>setInterval() method works in a similar way to window.<br>setTimeout(), except that it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds.<br>
    <h3>Animation</h3>
    The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page.<br> As an example, let’s create a web page that shows a colored square, and make it rotate.<br> Create a folder called animation that contains files called index.<br>html , styles.<br>css and main js.
    <h3>requestAnimationFrame</h3>
    This method of the window object works in much the same way as the window.<br>setInterval() method, although it has a number of improvements to optimize its performance.<br> These include making the most of the browser’s built-in graphics-handling capabilities, and not running the animation when the tab is inactive, resulting in a much smoother performance.<br>
    Consider Using CSS Instead
    The rotation animation example demonstrates how JavaScript can be used to perform animations in the browser.<br> It could also be achieved using pure CSS animation with the following style rules in styles.<br>css :
    <br>
    #square {
        margin: 100px;
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        background: #cc0;
        animation: spin 4s linear infinite;
    }
    @keyframes spin { from { transform:rotate(0deg); } to { transform:rotate(3600deg); } }
    In general, it is typically better to use CSS for any animation effects, although there may be times when JavaScript might be the better solution.<br>

    <h2>HTML5 APIs Chapter 14</h2>
    <h3>The data- Attribute</h3>
    The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser.<br>
    <h3>localStorage</h3>
    If a browser supports the Web Storage API, the window object will have a property called localStorage, which is a native object with a number of properties and methods used to store data.<br>
    <h3>Geolocation</h3>
    The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device.<br> This means it can be used to find the user’s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving.<br>
    <h3>Web Workers</h3>
    We saw in earlier chapters that JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning that only one process can run at one time.<br> Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript.<br>
    <h3>Websockets</h3>
    Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server – also known as push messaging.<br> This means that a connection is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are received.<br>
    <h3>Multimedia</h3>
    An audio clip can be inserted into a page with the -audio- tag, using the src attribute to point to the audio file:
    -audio src='/song.<br>mp3' controls-
    Your browser does not support the audio element.<br>
    -/audio-
    <h3>Drawing with Canvas</h3>
    The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn onto a web page in real time using JavaScript.<br>A canvas element is a rectangular element on the web page.<br>It has a coordinate system that starts at (0,0) in the top-left corner.<br>To add a canvas element to a page, the -canvas- tag is used specifying a height and width .<br>Anything placed inside the tag will only display if the canvas element is unsupported:
    -canvas id='canvas' width='400' height='400'>Sorry, but your browser does not support the canvas element -canvas
