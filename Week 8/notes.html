    <h1>HTML5 and CSS3
    Chapter 8</h1>
    <h2>Transforms</h2>
    The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page. 
    <br>
    <h2>Translation</h2>
    Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. 
    <h2>Scaling</h2>
    The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. <br>
    Note that you shouldn’t declare a new transform : because of the cascade, a second transform would override the first.  <br>To declare multiple transformations, provide a space-separated list of transform functions.
    <h2>Rotation</h2>
    The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. 
    <h2>Skew</h2>
    The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. <br> 
    Changing the Origin of the Transform
    As we hinted at earlier, you can control the origin from which your transforms are applied.  <br>This is done using the transform-origin property.  <br>It has the same syntax as the background-position property, and defaults to the center of the object  <br>(so that scales and rotations will be around the center of the box by default).
    <h2>Transitions</h2>
    Animation has certainly been possible for some time with JavaScript, but native CSS transitions generally require less client-side processing, so they’ll usually appear smoother.  <br>On mobile devices with limited computing power, this can be a lifesaver.
    <h2>The transition-duration Property</h2>
    The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: <br>
    The transition-timing-function Property
    The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail.
    <br>
    .ad-ad2 h1 span {
        transition-property: transform; 
        transition-duration: 0.2s;  
        transition-timing-function: ease-out;
        transition-delay: 50ms;
    }
    <br>
    Multiple Transitions
    transition-property: transform, color; 
    transition-duration: 0.2s;  
    transition-timing-function: ease-out;
    transition-delay: 50ms;
    <br>
    
    transition-property: transform, color; 
    transition-duration: 0.2s, 0.1s;  
    transition-timing-function: ease-out, linear;
    transition-delay: 50ms;
    <h2>Animations</h2>
    Transitions animate elements over time; however, they’re limited in what they can do.
    <h2>Keyframes</h2>
    To animate an element in CSS, you first create a named animation, then attach it to an element in that element’s property declaration block. <br>
    For an animation called myAnimation , the @keyframes rule would look like this: <br>
    @-webkit-keyframes myAnimation { 
        /* put animation keyframes here */
    } <br>
    @keyframes myAnimation { 
        /* put animation keyframes here */
    } <br>
    animation-timing-function
    Like the transition-timing-function property, the animation-timing-function determines how the animation will progress over its duration. 
    <br>
    .verbose {
        animation-name: appearDisappear; 
        animation-duration: 300ms; 
        animation-timing-function: ease-in;
        animation-iteration-count: 1;
        animation-direction: alternate;
        animation-delay: 5s;
        animation-fill-mode: backwards;
        animation-play-state: running;
    } <br>
    /* shorthand */
    .concise {
        animation: 300ms ease-in alternate 5s backwards appearDisappear;
    }
    <br>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    
    <h2>Canvas</h2>
    With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript. This can improve the performance of our websites by avoiding the need to download images off the network. With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns. In addition, canvas gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images and even video. 
    <br>
    <h2>Creating a canvas Element</h2>
    The first step to using canvas is to add a canvas element to the page:
    -canvas> <br>
        Sorry! Your browser doesn’t support Canvas.
    -canvas> --> <br>
    The text in between the canvas tags will only be shown if the canvas element is not supported by the visitor’s browser. <br>
    Since drawing on the canvas is done using JavaScript, we’ll need a way to grab the element from the DOM. We’ll do so by giving our canvas an ID: <br>
    -canvas id="myCanvas" class="myCanvas"-
    Sorry! Your browser doesn’t support Canvas.
    -/canvas- <br>
    The canvas element takes both a width and height attribute, which must also be set. <br>
    Before we can draw onto a canvas, we need to grab hold of the canvas element on our page: <br>
    var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
    We obtain our drawing context by calling the getContext method and passing it the string "2d" , since we’ll be drawing in two dimensions:
    var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
    var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
    The object that’s returned by getContext is an instance of Canvas Rendering Context2D.  <br>In this chapter, we’ll refer to it as simply “the context object” for brevity.
    To draw a rectangle with a red border, we first define the stroke color: <br>
    var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");     
    var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
    context.strokeStyle = "red";
    <h2>The Canvas Coordinate System</h2>
    As you may have gathered, the coordinate system in the canvas element is different from the Cartesian coordinate system you learned in math class.  <br>In the canvas coordinate system, the top-left corner is (0,0). If the canvas is 200 pixels by 200 pixels,
    <h2>SVG</h2>
    SVG stands forScalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML. <br> A major selling point of vector graphics in general is that, unlike bitmap images (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF), vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or shrink them down. 
    <h2>What's XML?</h2>
    XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. Like HTML, it’s a markup metalanguage.
    <h2>Canvas versus SVG</h2>
    Canvas allows for pixel manipulation By contrast, what you draw to SVG is accessible via the DOM, because its mode is retained mode,
    <h2>Making Elements Draggable</h2>
    The next step is to make our images draggable. In order to do that, we add the draggable attribute to them, and set the value to true : <br>
    -img data-src="https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/html5-css3-for-the-real-world-2nd-edition/images/computer-mouse-pic.svg" width="30" 
    ↵alt="mouse treat" id="mouse1" draggable="true"> <br>
    -img data-src="https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/html5-css3-for-the-real-world-2nd-edition/images/computer-mouse-pic.svg" width="30" 
    ↵alt="mouse treat" id="mouse2" draggable="true"> <br>
    -img data-src="https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/html5-css3-for-the-real-world-2nd-edition/images/computer-mouse-pic.svg" width="30" 
    ↵alt="mouse treat" id="mouse3" draggable="true"> <br>
