<h3>Chap 2 Notes</h3>
-The syntax used by JavaScript is known as a C-style syntax because of its similarities with theC programming language
<br>
-It’s considered best practice to combine the two and write each statement on a new line, terminated by a semi-colon.

-JavaScript has seven different data types. Six of them areprimitive data typesand are listed below:
String, Symbol (The symbol primitive data type was only introduced in ES6.), Number, Boolean, Undefined, Declaring and Assigning<br>
<br>Variables have to be declared before they can be used.
<br>-Using const and let to declare variables means they areblock scoped, so their value only exists inside the block they are declared in.

<br>-Scope is an important concept in programming. It refers to where a constant or variable is accessible by the program. There are two common scopes that are often referred to in programs: global scope and local scope.
<br>-Type coercion can be difficult to spot type errors in your code. The best approach is to try to be very explicit about the types of values you are working with. If you need to change the type, then do it manually, rather than relying on type coercion to do it for you.

<br>-Undefined is the value given to variables that have not been assigned a value. We've already seen it used earlier in this chapter when variables are declared without being assigned a value. It can also occur if an object’s property doesn’t exist or a function has a missing parameter. It is basically JavaScript’s way of saying "I can’t find a value for this."

<br>Null means 'no value'. It can be thought of as a placeholder that JavaScript uses to say "there should be a value here, but there isn’t at the moment."
/*
    const question = "What is supers real name?"
    const answer = prompt(question);
    alert(`You answered ${question}`);
  
*/
<h3>Chap 3</h3>
-Arrays
An array is an ordered list of values. To create an array literal, simply write a pair of square brackets:

<h3>Chap 4</h3>
-Maps
Maps were another data structure introduced in the ES6 specification. They are a convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs, and are similar to 'hashes', or 'hash tables' or 'dictionaries' in other programming languages.
<br>-We start by declaring a variable called bottles . Any variables that are used in the loop must be initialized before the loop is run, otherwise there will be an error when they are mentioned.
<br>-Arrow functions can be identified by the 'arrow' symbol, => that gives them their name. The parameters come before the arrow and the main body of the function comes after. Arrow functions are always anonymous, so if you want to refer to them, you must assign them to a variable. For example, the square function we wrote earlier can be written like so:
const square = x => x*x;
<br>-Call Back: A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a callback.
